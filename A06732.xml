            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12170:4"/>
when they proceed out of a hearty affection towards the ſame; the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof hath emboldened me (Right Honourable) at this time, to preſent your Lordſhip with this poore ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; preſuming it ſhall finde acceptance with your Honour, becauſe it is willingly offered to the uſe and ſervice of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though it bee but as Goates haire in compariſon of the gold of Ophir, which others bring, or as the poore widowes Mite, in reſpect of thoſe larger ſummes, which others caſt into this treaſury of the Church, in this learned age. And indeed I cannot ſo over-love this ſlender peece which now comes forth into the world, as to think it of more worth than many of his fellowes, which are willingly content to die in the eare, rather than to ſtand in white ſheetes, that they might ſpeake to the eye; much leſſe can I ſet ſuch a high price upon it, as to ſend it abroad with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of credit and commendation, that might beſpeake and procure friends where
<pb facs="tcp:12170:5"/>
it is unknowne. It was firſt ſpoken to a popular Auditory, without any thoughts or intentions of further publication; and therfore it ſtudied nothing more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſuch a familiar expreſſion, as might beſt ſuite with vulgar capacities: and now that it comes into the open light, and publike view, it cannot well leave that native language which it learned in the Pulpit, to frame it ſelfe to a ſtile and phraſe of ſpeech, conciſe and pithie, more befitting the Preſſe: Such as it is I make bold to ſend it abroad into the world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your name and honourable protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it may remaine, as a pledge and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of that humble reſpect and ſervice that I owe unto your Lordſhip. It comes therefore unto you, not as a Tutor with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to teach you what you know not, but as a Pupill for protection, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſheltred under the ſhadow of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Patronage, it may finde the ſafer paſſage in thoſe unknowne wayes, and places whither it ſhall travell. There is
<pb facs="tcp:12170:5"/>
none that I know, in our Engliſh tongue, that hath gone before me in handling that portion of Scripture, which this enſuing Treatiſe, that now comes to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips hands, is ſpent upon; and, if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not, there are few paſſages in holy Scripture more neceſſary and uſefull for all ſorts and conditions of men, than this is, for it is a diſcovery of thoſe thoughts of peace, which GOD carries towards the ſonnes of men, in the primary intention of that courſe of providence that hee hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for their good; and withall, a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that care and diligence, that ſhould bee in every one to ſerve this providence of GOD in the day of grace, by applying himſelfe unto him in the uſe of thoſe meanes, wherein mercy may be had, if it be ſought for. And theſe meditations, as they are fit for every one to think upon, ſo more eſpecially for men of high place and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe, like high trees, they are more ſubject to thoſe windes of temptation, which may breed in them a forgetfulneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:12170:6"/>
of both; whereas by this meanes they might eaſily prevent thoſe two dangerous rocks of preſumption and deſpaire, upon which many daſh and ſplit the precious veſſels of their ſoules, and ſuffer eternall ſhipwracke: for hee that firmely beleeves, and perſwades himſelfe that there is ſuch thoughts of peace in GOD towards him, as that mercy may bee had if it bee ſought for, hee cannot eaſily deſparie of finding mercy, if with care and diligence hee apply himſelfe to the ſeeking of it; and hee that layes this foundation, that GOD will bee ſought unto for the obtaining of thoſe bleſſings which hee hath promiſed, hee cannot eaſily preſume of finding mercy, while hee lives in the neglect of thoſe meanes that lead unto it.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is nothing more availeable for the rectifying of the judgment and underſtanding of a man in the myſteries of ſalvation, than a right apprehenſion and conceit, touching the will of God; to wit, what God is willing to doe for him, and what hee willeth and requireth him to doe for the obtaining of it. The cleare underſtanding of this, it rectifies a mans faith in matters to be beleeved, either concerning God, or himſelfe: it regulates his obedience in things to be done, teaching him how to pray aright with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be heard, and that is, when he asketh any thing according to the will of God<note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 5.14.</note>, directing him to walk aright in the way of life; and that is, when he is neither miſ-led in his way, nor negligent in his work, but applyes himſelfe to God in a wiſe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly cariage, ſuitable to that courſe of providence that he hath taken for his good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12170:8"/>Touching this will of God, there is ſomething de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in this enſuing Treatiſe, by which every one may take a true ſcantling of the good will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that God beares unto him, by thoſe warme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions of love which he finds in the Goſpell. Much more might have beene ſaid in this argument, and perhaps in time may.</p>
            <p>Mean while, for the preventing of all miſtakes in that which is ſaid already, be pleaſed (Courteous Reader) to take notice, that it is no part of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and intention, in any part of theſe following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes &amp; meditations, to enter the liſts of that diſpute and controverſie which is now in agitation amongst the learned Divines of the reformed Churches, touching the will of God in the decree of Election. The heat of that contention hath already troubled and diſquieted the peace of the Church too much, and want of moderation in ſome on both ſides, through the indiſcreet handling, of that unſearchable depth, doth ſtill beget ill bloud in the veins of that body, that ſhould grow up unto an holy Temple in the Lord. As in all other Controverſies, ſo in this, the right ſtating of the matter in queſtion, helps much for the clearing of the truth; and if that be firſt done, (I hope) it willfully appeare, that the concluſion here maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned touching the will of God, doth no wayes border upon that controverſie; for the matter there in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, is, Whether the decree of Election, as it is terminated, and pitched upon particular perſons, be abſolute, and irreſpective, or out of a conſideration of fore-ſeene faith and perſeverance: that is, whether God doe equally will the ſalvation of all, and have
<pb facs="tcp:12170:8"/>
no abſolute and irreſpective purpoſe of ſaving one more than another, before he looke at different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in them. It is freely confeſſed<note n="b" place="margin">

unto them, ſave onely in that previous purpoſe of ſpeciall love, which he is pleaſed of himſelfe, and for his owne ſake, to ſhew to one more than to another. And this ſeems to be the mind of thoſe learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in the Synod of Dort<note n="d" place="margin">

From whence it appeares, that the matter in queſtion amongst the learned, is onely touching the Decree of Election, how man is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and looked upon, when God paſſeth that decree upon him, whether barely and nakedly, as abſtracted from all qualifications and conditions which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the covenant of grace, or cloathed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with ſuch preparatorie gifts of grace, as doe by vertue of Gods promiſe, intitle him to eternall life. This queſtion I purpoſely wave, and meddle not withall in this enſuing Treatiſe, but take that which
<pb facs="tcp:12170:9"/>
is generally granted by the more moderate, and beſt learned on both ſides: to wit, that all mankind are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſalvation, upon ſuch terms and conditions as are expreſſed in the Covenant of grace: that is, if they repent of their ſinnes, and beleeve in Chriſt, and that when God offers life and ſalvation to all and every one in the miniſtery of the Word, he is truely willing, and doth ſeriouſly intend to beſtow the ſame upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in that way that he hath commanded them to ſeek it, and according to that courſe of providence that he hath taken for their good: that is, if they will apply themſelves unto him, and follow the counſell and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that he gives them. And this, if I miſtake not, is the general doctrine of the ancient Fathers, the learned Schoolmen, and many modern Divines: both Papiſts and Proteſtants, Lutherans and Calviniſts, there is none that is well read &amp; verſed in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that can much doubt or queſtion the judgement of any of them, ſave only of thoſe who follow and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>Firſt, it appeares by <hi>Muſculus</hi> in his Common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the redemption which is purchaſed by Chriſt, is upon ſome condition applyable to the whole world, and to every particular man from the firſt to the laſt<note n="e" place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:12170:10"/>
generall offer of it; for though all be not made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it, yet their ruine and deſtruction, which is of themſelves, doth not any wayes prejudice or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the generall good will of God towards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor hinder, but that the benefit of redemption may be thus farre termed univerſall, as that it is in ſome ſort intended for all, and upon ſome conditions appliable unto all: and he illuſtrates this by two ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes: Firſt, of the Sun, which may be ſaid to ſend forth a generall light and influence into all places, and all creatures, and to make them fruitfull, though many of them remaine barren, becauſe the defect and hinderance is not in the nature of the ſun, but in other letts and impediments which hinder the effectuall working of it: Even ſo (ſaith he) it is with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption purchaſed by Chriſt; that Reprobates and wicked men doe not receive it, it is not for want of good will in God towards them; nor through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that grace he offereth to them, for it is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for all, and in the preaching of the Goſpell are all invited to it: &amp; therfore it is not fit that it ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the title of a generall benefit, becauſe the ſons of perdition, through their owne fault, deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of it: for as a Medicine may be ſaid to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, though it doe not actually cure all diſeaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath ſuch a vertue in it, that it would heale them, if it were rightly and orderly applyed unto them: Even ſo the bloud of Chriſt may be termed an univerſall medicine, becauſe it hath ſufficient vertue in it to heale the ſins of the whole world, though it doe actually cure none, but ſuch onely to whom it is applyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12170:10"/>The other ſimilitude which he bringeth for the illuſtration of this point, is drawne from a cuſtome which was uſed amongst the Iewes, who in the yeare of Iubile, proclaimed a generall liberty to all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whoſoever would, might goe out free, though many remained ſtill in their former bondage, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the benefit of liberty when it was freely offered and tendered unto them: even ſo in the Goſpell, there is a Proclamation publiſhed of a generall pardon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt, which is offered and tendered to all and every one, upon ſuch conditions as are expreſſed in the Covenant of grace. The reaſon why many miſſe of it, is not for want of mercy in God, but becauſe they are wanting to themſelves, and doe not ſeek for it according to his will.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12170:11"/>
but conditionally; for whatſoever God abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely willeth, that is alwayes effected, and cannot be hindered by any thing in the creature; but what he willeth onely upon condition, that may be hindered, becauſe ſuch as faile in the condition by a voluntary neglect, do thereby hinder and keep away good things from them. And thus ſhould every one pray for the ſalvation of others, not abſolutely that God would bring them to ſalvation, whether they repent or no, but that he would bleſſe the meanes unto them, and worke grace in them, whereby they may repent and turne unto him, in that way of obedience, that leads to life.</p>
            <p>And againe, he ſheweth that the Scripture doth ſo deſcribe the antecedent love of God towards Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, as that there are certaine degrees of love to be acknowledged in it, whereof the firſt is more generall, and belongs to all, and out of this love he ſends Chriſt into the world, to pay a ſufficient price for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of all, and by that payment to make them capable of ſalvation, upon ſuch conditions as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the new Covenant: and out of this love it is that he wills the ſalvation of all, and ſo according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls them to repentance, that they might be ſaved. As it is amongst men, he that uſeth all fitting and convenient meanes to gaine another mans good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him, and to draw his love and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and for that end, makes a ſignification of the good will and affection he beares him, and ſhews himſelfe ready upon all occaſions to doe any good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for him; and withall, ſhews him ſuch arguments and reaſons, ſuch motives and inducements, as are
<pb facs="tcp:12170:12"/>
in their owne nature apt to perſwade him thereunto, he may be truly ſaid to deſire his love and friendſhip; though he doe not prevaile with him for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, he hath ſufficiently managed and officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his part, without omitting of any thing that was fit and requiſite for him to doe: and the fault and hinderance lies wholly in him that was ſo inflexible, that no meanes could prevaile with him, or move him to imbrace ſuch a friendly motion. Even ſo the caſe ſtands betweene God and man, in reſpect of that generall good will and affection that God beares to him: God ſpeakes unto him, and deales with him, as with a reaſonable creature; and if he doe not prevail with him, the fault is not in God, or in the meanes that are uſed by him, but onely in man, who will not apply himſelfe unto God, and ſerve his providence in that way and courſe that is taken for his good: and he illuſtrates this by two ſimilitudes: Firſt of the Sun<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12170:12"/>The other ſimilitude he uſeth, is drawne from a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or bondſlave, who hath a friend, who layes down ſuch a ſumme of money for his ranſome, but withall addes this caution, that he ſhall then come to enjoy the benefit of this Ranſome, when he comes to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the kindneſſe that ſuch a friend hath done for him, and humbly ſues, and ſeeks that he may enjoy it: but if he value his liberty at ſo low a rate, that he contemneth and deſpiſeth that which hath beene done for him, then it is ſo ordered, that he ſhall be in the ſame place and condition with thoſe that are not redeemed at all. Even ſo it is here, there is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent price laid downe by Chriſt for the redemption of all Man-kinde: now if any one undervalue this mercy, and make light of it, he may be juſtly upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with this benefit: and though he cavill and quarrell that hee is not redeemed, for as much as he ſtill lies in priſon, yet will this availe him little, becauſe the reaſon why he continues ſtill in priſon, is not for want of a ſufficient ranſome to releaſe him thence, but for want of looking after it: even ſo it is here; all men are by nature captives and bondſlaves: Chriſt hath laid downe a ſufficient price for their ranſome, but with this caution, that the benefit of it ſhall accrue onely to ſuch as doe repent of their ſinnes, and beleeve in him.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why ſo many miſſe of that benefit, is, becauſe they will not beleeve in him, nor lay downe their weapons of rebellion, which they have taken up againſt him.</p>
            <p>Now from all theſe teſtimonies, it is plaine and evident, that amongst thoſe who are moſt oppoſite to
<pb facs="tcp:12170:13"/>
the <hi>Lutherans</hi> opinion in the matter of Election, yet many of them doe ſo conceive of Gods purpoſe therein, as that it includes nothing in it contrary to that will which is revealed, and generally propounded in the Goſpell. All ſides grant, that life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is generally offered to all in the new Covenant, and that God ſeriouſly intends to give it to all and every one, upon ſuch conditions as are there expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that is all I contend for in this enſuing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Now that God may be ſaid ſeriouſly to will the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any, there are two things neceſſary:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> That there be in God a reall purpoſe and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of giving life unto him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> That the conditions required for the obtaining of it, be ſome wayes poſsible, not by the ſtrength of nature, or the power and ability of his own free-will, but by and through thoſe gracious helps which are afforded unto him in the miniſtery of the Word.</p>
            <p>To have made up the Treatiſe full and compleat, it had beene requiſite to have handled this ſecond point, which I could eaſily have ſupplyed, out of ſome notes and meditations that lie by me: and it was more than once in my thoughts ſo to have done; but my ſecond thoughts reſolved againſt it, becauſe the laying open of that point, would require a larger diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe than could well have beene concluded within the bounds or limits of a reaſon or proofe, (as here it muſt have been) as alſo in regard that the former point onely was inſiſted upon, when that Sermon was preached. If thou ſhalt receive any profit or benefit by that which is here delivered, it is that onely which I
<pb facs="tcp:12170:13"/>
have principally endeavored and aymed at. If I miſſe of my purpoſe, and the ſucceſſe be not anſwerable to my deſire, yet let it finde that acceptance at thine hands, which thou art ready to afford to all ſuch as unfainedly wiſh thy welfare.</p>

               <p n="3">3 Chriſt weepes for thoſe miſeries <hi>whereof himſelfe ſhould beare no part;</hi> for they were to come upon Jeruſalem a long while after his death: and therefore it concludes more ſtrongly for thoſe to lay to heart and weepe for the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of others, which may poſſibly bee inwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and involved within the compaſſe of the danger. When a man heares of lamentable fires <hi>in the fartheſt and remoteſt parts of the Kingdome,</hi> though hee have no feare of receiving any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall hurt and dammage from the ſame, yet common humanity layes a tie upon him to bee moved and affected with pitie and compaſſion towards the miſery of thoſe that periſh and are conſumed thereby; but when his neighbours

               <p>Now for a man that ſpeakes out of depth of ſorow, and fulneſſe of griefe, it is nothing ſtrange for him to breake off his ſpeech, and leave it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; for as it is the nature of joy to inlarge the heart, and dilate the ſpirits, &amp; ſo ſet open as it were a wide door for the thoughts of the heart to goe out and vent themſelves; ſo it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſorrow to contract and ſtraiten, to narrow and draw together the ſpirits, and as it were to ſhut the doore of the ſoule, ſo that like as it is with a <hi>veſſell,</hi> though it be full of liquor, yet if the mouth of it be ſtopped, none will flow out; even ſo it was here with Chriſt: having begun to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12170:46"/>
ſpeake, he was ſo overwhelmed with griefe, and ſo deeply affected with the eſtate and condition of Jeruſalem, that he could <hi>not ſpeake out, but was even conſtrained to weep out the reſt of the ſentence,</hi> leaving the full ſenſe and meaning to be gathered and ſupplyed <hi>out of his teares:</hi> as is uſed in ſuch paſſionate and patheticall ſpeeches.

               <p>That Chriſt did ſeriouſly will and deſire the welfare of Jeruſalem, even that part of Jeruſalem which was afterward miſerably deſtroyed, for refuſing the mercy that was tendered and offered unto her: neither did he will this as man onely, but likewiſe as God; the will of the humanity, and the will of the Deity were not contrary, but ſubordinate; they did both meet in the object or thing willed; that is, in the good and ſalvation of Jeruſalem. And that hee did ſeriouſly will it, there be three things in the Text ſeeme plainely to evince: 1. <hi>His teares, as hath been ſhewed before.</hi> 2. His patience and long-ſuffering, becauſe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the killing of ſo many Prophets, as had beene ſlaine before, the contempt and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of ſo many mercies as had beene offered before; yet even to <hi>that very day hee carried

thoughts of peace towards her,</hi> and accordingly ſent her meanes of peace, even ſuch meanes, as <hi>from that day forward</hi> ſhe ſhould never enjoy the like againe. And what more evident ſigne of his ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intentions than this, that he is ſo long, before his thoughts can be taken off from it. 3. His comming to her in his owne perſon: when the Phyſitian doth not onely preſcribe remedies for his ſick Patient, and gives order what hee ſhall take, but alſo comes himſelfe in his owne perſon to apply them, leſt there ſhould be any miſtake or neglect; it is a ſigne he doth ſeriouſly will and deſire his recovery; ſo when Chriſt <hi>comes himſelfe in perſon to Ieruſalem,</hi> as to his ſick patient; it ſhewes how willing and deſirous hee was to worke a cure upon this diſeaſed party, and to heale that was amiſſe; and this is that which himſelf teſtifies, &amp; ſpeaks out plainly elſewhere,<note n="f" place="margin">

               <p>As for that firſt expoſition of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which interprets the Apoſtle of an abſolute will in God, and reſtraines it onely to ſome of all ſorts, though it bee received by many, yet it ſeemes not ſo proper and ſutable to the ſcope of the place; becauſe the words are brought in as a reaſon or motive to preſſe the exhortation laid downe before; to wit, that prayers and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations be made for all men; and therefore muſt be of equall extent and largeneſſe with it. The word <hi>All</hi> muſt be ſo taken in the <hi>Motive</hi> annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it is in the <hi>duty enjoyned; God wils the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all thoſe for whom he will have his people make prayers and ſupplications:</hi> Their charity in praying muſt reach to all, becauſe God will have all men ſaved. Now the word <hi>All,</hi> in the duty injoyned, as <hi>Calvin</hi> well obſerves<note n="x" place="margin">

So the Prophet injoynes the Iſraelites, when they were in captivity under the King of <hi>Babel,</hi> to <hi>ſeek the proſperity of the City, and to pray for the Kings welfare, and the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his government</hi>

                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:12170:139"/>When God pronounceth the ſentence of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in the conſcience, hee doth in the ſame breath <hi>ſpeake peace unto the ſoule:</hi> and this he doth by Chriſt and the Goſpell; for whenſoever God ſealeth the pardon of ſinne to any, it is for <hi>Chriſts ſake</hi> that he doth it; the <hi>bloud of Chriſt firſt ſpeaks for him,</hi> before God <hi>ſpeake peace unto him;</hi> and when hee doth ſpeake peace unto him, that the voice of God may be diſcerned from the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sathan, who lulls men aſleepe with a falſe peace; there be meanes left for the diſcovery of it, even thoſe meanes by which it is wrought, to wit, the <hi>voice of the Scripture,</hi> and <hi>the voice of a mans owne conſcience.</hi> God firſt <hi>ſpeakes peace in the rule,</hi> which is the <hi>Goſpell of peace,</hi> by laying out a generall deſcription of ſuch qualifications and conditions, as have the promiſe of peace made unto them; and the <hi>conſcience,</hi> by reflecting upon the rule, and a mans owne wayes, and comparing them together, doth in ſome meaſure ſee that the <hi>inward peace</hi> which ſhe feels in her ſelfe, is <hi>true peace,</hi> and of a right ſtampe, becauſe the Scripture <hi>ſpeakes peace unto her, as well as God,</hi> and ſhe finds in her ſelfe ſome ground and warrant whereupon to apply to her ſelfe the <hi>promiſe of peace.</hi> But when a man is confidently perſwaded that he is at peace with God, who was never earneſt with God in prayer for the obtaining of it, when the Scripture doth not <hi>ſpeake peace unto him,</hi> and yet he flatters himſelfe that he <hi>ſhall have peace,</hi> when he builds <hi>caſtles of peace</hi> in the ayre, but doth not finde in himſelfe ſuch qualifications to which
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:12170:140"/>
the <hi>promiſe of peace is made,</hi> that is a ſigne it is but a vaine confidence, and foole-hardie preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no <hi>true peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning the <hi>manner</hi> how it is wrought, it is <hi>leiſurely and by degrees;</hi> in the orderly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this <hi>peace,</hi> the eye of the ſoule is firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the Goſpel, to ſee that there is a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of peace,</hi> wherein <hi>conditions of peace are freely tendered</hi> to every ſoule that will imbrace them; and this lets every one ſee to whom the Goſpell is preached, that there is a <hi>poſsibility of obtaining peace,</hi> and ſo ſets open a doore of hope for him.</p>
               <p>Then ſecondly, God comes to hold <hi>a treaty with the ſoule</hi> in the miniſtery of the Word, <hi>about the termes and conditions of this peace,</hi> lets her ſee what ſinnes ſhee muſt forſake, what duties of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience ſhe muſt apply her ſelfe unto, if ſhe will have and enjoy <hi>this peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then thirdly, God comes to prevail with her by his Spirit and his grace, to gaine her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to the <hi>conditions</hi> that are required.</p>
               <p>And then laſtly, hereupon there be articles of agreement drawne betweene God and the ſoule, and a <hi>concluſion of peace made up,</hi> and a <hi>covenant of peace actually entred into.</hi> God now begins to <hi>ſpeak peace</hi> to the ſoule, and ſhe begins to find and <hi>feele peace in her ſelfe,</hi> and ſo continues till either ſhee fall into new ſinnes, or meet with new temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which doe againe diſturbe and <hi>unſettle this peace,</hi> which is but weake at firſt, and eaſily trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with doubts and feares; for howſoever this
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:12170:140"/>
peace be <hi>uſually more ſenſibly felt,</hi> when a man firſt begins with purpoſe of heart to cleave unto God, than afterward; yet it is <hi>more weakly grounded,</hi> and therefore more eaſily ſhaken with temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: it is the long cuſtome of exerciſe and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that muſt more and more eſtabliſh the heart in the cleare evidence and aſſurance of it: the conſcience may be ſoone <hi>daubed over with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered mortar,</hi> and quickly ſtilled with a <hi>falſe peace;</hi> but a <hi>ſound peace, at leaſt in any eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and meaſure of it,</hi> is not ſo quickly attained unto. <hi>Superficiall things are done in the halfe of that time that ſubſtantiall things are a working:</hi> a <hi>wound or a ſore may be quickly skinned over,</hi> but it requires more time to heale it at the bottome, and to work a perfect cure upon it. So <hi>a falſe peace is ſoone at the higheſt,</hi> and comes quickly to her full growth: like <hi>Ionas gourd,</hi> that comes up in a night, and then it is ſo confident and peremptory, that nothing can unſettle or diſturb it: but <hi>ſound peace,</hi> it comes up more leiſurely, &amp; requires longer time before it can grow up to any great height. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when men are no ſooner ſtept out of an ill courſe, and begin to look forward to that which is good, but preſently they are filled with ſuch a <hi>meaſure of peace,</hi> that they make not the leaſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of their reconciliation with God, nor feare any danger at all of being deceived: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can trouble or ſtumble them in that matter: this is no good ſigne of any <hi>ſound peace.</hi> There is a generation of men in the world, who as at firſt they <hi>take up a peace</hi> upon a falſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:12170:141"/>
of an abſolute promiſe made unto them; ſo they hold it afterward in the ſame tenure. And therefore, though they neglect any duty that God requires, or fall into any ſinne that hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids, it doth not abate or diminiſh any thing of their peace, but as they tooke it up <hi>independently upon any qualification in themſelves,</hi> before they either repented of their ſinnes, or entred into Covenant with God: ſo breach of Covenant doth nothing trouble or diſturbe the ſame; but let ſuch reade their doome in the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

Chriſt who was the <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> and <hi>came into the world to ſettle peace on earth,</hi> yet it was a holy and religious peace, not a ſinfull peace that was intended by him; and ſo he would have his Diſciples to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it,<note n="t" place="margin">
